A token based IM, file sharing app intented for *secure* "use and throw" kind of conversations.

### About the name
OneDot6 is a codename, until a proper name is decided. Inspired from the Golden Ratio. Derived from: [PHIe1]e-1, "[]" is the floor function.

### Proposed technology
Python (Bottle framework) for handshaking and Node.JS (Possibly) for the IM sockets.
Database is not required, but a flatfile TMP file per session would be used.
